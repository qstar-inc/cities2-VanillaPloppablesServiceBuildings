## DISCLAIMER
> This mod requires [Asset Packs Manager](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/78903/Windows) which is highly experimental.
This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors.
Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save.
But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage.
Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.

This is the full collection package for all non-terrain conforming and non-functional static service buildings including upgrades.
- Currently only supports en-US l10n.
- Uses icons from Unified Icon Library and Asset Icon Library.

## Collection
This 'mod' adds a "Ploppable Services" menu on the main toolbar, next to the "Signature Buildings".
Inside the menu, you will find various categories which consist of Service buildings and their upgrades.
* Roads (5)
* Electricity (23)
* Water (13)
* Healthcare &amp; Deathcare (16)
* Garbage Management (12)
* Education &amp; Research (32)
* Fire &amp; Rescue (13)
* Police &amp; Administration (18)
* Transportation (51)
* Parks &amp; Recreation (19)
* Communications (13)

The Parks &amp; Recreation items require access to the DLC required for the items. They won't appear unless the DLC is acquired/active in your game.

#### ***IMPORTANT: Make sure all the dependencies are subscribed and loaded to the current playsets.***
